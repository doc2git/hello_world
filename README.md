# hello-world
This this my first githut Repository.
I write simple codes several years, since I like this.
But now I haven't stored any useful projects, all have been lost, just like the mokey picking corn.
From now on, I will insist to use github store and share them.
Long time later, I will earn many funy codes, functions, classes, mudules, databases, projects, and so on.
I belive in that, this decision maybe the best one of mime in this several years.
